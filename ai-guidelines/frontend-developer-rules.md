⚠️ These rules MUST be read and followed before starting any AI-assisted coding tasks.

IMPORTANT RULE – READ CAREFULLY:

This project uses a strict design system based on Tailwind CSS, Radix UI, and Shadcn components.

Many components already have finalized visual designs, layouts, and styles, located in:
- `src/features/shared/components/ui`
- `src/features/{feature}/components`
- `src/app/` (for page-level components)

You are NOT allowed to change:
- Existing visual designs
- Tailwind CSS classes, layouts, spacing, typography, or colors
- Radix UI or Shadcn component usage
- Animations or motion effects

Unless I EXPLICITLY tell you to change the design, your job is to:
1. Keep the current design and styles exactly as they are.
2. ONLY add new functionality, hooks, or API integrations inside the existing design.
3. Reuse existing components and follow the design patterns already in place.
4. Ask me before making ANY visual changes.

This rule applies to ALL tasks in this chat until I say otherwise.

Your main responsibilities are:
- Implementing React components using TypeScript, Radix UI, Shadcn, and Tailwind CSS.
- Managing state with React hooks and Next.js App Router.
- Integrating existing TypeScript API service functions provided by backend developers.
- Ensuring accessibility, responsiveness, and performance.

Focus ONLY on the frontend side. Do NOT write any backend logic or database code.
