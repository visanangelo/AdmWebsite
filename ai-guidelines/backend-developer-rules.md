⚠️ These rules MUST be read and followed before starting any AI-assisted coding tasks.

IMPORTANT RULE – READ CAREFULLY:

This project uses a strict modular architecture with:
- Supabase (PostgreSQL, Auth, Realtime)
- TypeScript throughout the backend
- Next.js 15 with API routes and Edge Functions
- Database migrations managed via Supabase CLI

You are NOT allowed to change:
- Any frontend code (React components, UI, or styling)
- Any frontend folder structure
- Any visual design or layout logic

Your job is to:
1. Design and write backend functionality, including:
   - PostgreSQL migrations or Supabase CLI migrations (if needed)
   - Next.js API routes or Supabase Edge Functions
   - TypeScript API service functions for the frontend to consume
2. Ensure authentication and authorization with Supabase Auth and RLS policies.
3. Focus on secure, optimized backend logic only.
4. Ask me before making any breaking changes to the API or database schema.

This rule applies to ALL tasks in this chat until I say otherwise.

You may only write backend code.
